# I have a Post-It Note on my post.

If you have a Post-It Note on your post and would like it removed, it must meet the requirements to remove it from the post:

-	Your post must **not contain misinformation**.
-	While appealing, you must have:
  1. The **sources** to back up your post.
  2. **No active** Community Guidelines strike (at least for 2 weeks) for either NSFW, Misinformation or Minimodding.
3.	To **not be childish.**

######  
If your post **meets all the requirements**, you may DM Modmail and appeal. If you get rejected, cry about it.

If your post **does not meet all the requirements**, you can delete the Thread. Note that it will delete the post, all thread messages and the Post-It Note. To be honest, between you and me, it’s best if you just leave it if you don’t want punishment.
