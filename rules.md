# Post-It Notes Rules
Post-It Notes do not represent LVEB’s viewpoint. Post-It Notes cannot be modified in any way by our Staff members (unless it doesn’t adhere to the [Post-It Note rules](https://lavie-est-belle.github.io/postit-notes/rules)). A post with a Post-It Note will not be removed by our Staff unless if it breaks the Community Guidelines.

* **General rule of thumb. No misinformation.**
  - **Do not deny that something exists** (e.g. “covid isn’t real”).
  - **Do not claim speculation** or an opinion. For example, “9/11 was an inside job”.
  - **No [opinions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion)/[speculation](https://www.google.com/search?q=speculation+definition) is allowed.** Facts only. Please leave a message inside the thread if it contains opinions or speculation.
  - **No biased language.** For example, “[Murderer] is a nice person because they gave me $20”
  - **Use reliable sources** (like Wikipedia). No untrustworthy sources. No sources that date around 15-30 years ago. You must also leave a source while leaving a Post-It Note.
  - **Don’t misuse Post-It Notes as message threads.** For example, Post-It Noting a post and leaving “bro its ok” or “wtf”. Please leave a Post-It Note stating facts and why you believe the post was misinforming users.
  - All Community Guidelines still apply to Post-It Notes.

Failure to abide by the Post-It Note rules and/or the Community Guidelines will result in removal from being a Contributor and/or [termination](/).
